## The challenge

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard



  
## What I learned

I focused on working with grids and it turned out easier that I would've excepted. I worked with min and max width/height properties and upped up my responsive CSS skills.
